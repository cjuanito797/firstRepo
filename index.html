  <p>Hello world, my name is Juan Lizarraga and I am a junior studying computer science at the University of Nebraska Omaha. Currently I am an intern at Union Pacific working with the ITL packaging team, I decided not to take a pure coding based internship because I have the freedom to work on coding projects for use in ITL as well as gaining knowledge from other areas, diversifying my knowledge</p>
