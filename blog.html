    <p>Today was my first day of school, and I had a big lunch, so for dinner I only had a salad. Today was my first day of school and it was a really good day. I managed to learn alot of fascinating things about object oriented programming.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I had a big lunch, so I decided to not eat that much. This morning I actually managed to go to the gym so my day is already off to a very good start: </p>

    <p>Today was the first day of the Spring 2021 semester. So far it is off to a fantastic start. This semester I am taking a more considerable amount of classes. I am taking 17 credit hours which is the most that I have taken so far at my time at UNO. It should be fun I have a mixture of programming classes with mathematics. I am fairly good at managing my time so while this may be hard it will not be impossible. If you know of anybody who might be going through some tough times go ahead and send them one of these: <img src = "fonsi.jpg" alt = "fonsi"></p>
